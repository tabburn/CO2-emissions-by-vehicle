# Regression Analysis of Emissions per Vehicle
This project uses current [2023 data](https://github.com/tabburn/CO2-emissions-by-vehicle/blob/main/resources/2023fuelconsumptionCO2.csv) of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per vehicle to predict emissions of future vehicles. The predictions are drawn by looking at different features and through exploring different types of regression models with the goal of finding a line of best fit to include a high r<sup>2</sup> and variance score and a low mean squared error.

## Summary
The purpose of this project is to explore different regression models with the goal of finding a line of best fit against the data. The model should fit the data well and, ideally, explain the variance. With a good model we would be able to predict the emissions ratings of any given vehicle. This data analysis answers questions like:

* Which regression model best fits my data?
* Does adding more predictor variables help account for variance?
* How can we best predict emissions of future vehicles?

## About the Data
The [dataset](https://github.com/tabburn/CO2-emissions-by-vehicle/blob/main/resources/2023fuelconsumptionCO2.csv) used in this analysis is provided by the Canadian government and the original source can be found [here](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/98f1a129-f628-4ce4-b24d-6f16bf24dd64?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkML0101ENSkillsNetwork1047-2023-01-01). It is currently listed as the English version of '2023 Fuel Consumption Ratings (2023-04-04)'. It provides model-specific fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light-duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada. The data is clean and contains no null values. More detailed information about the dataset can be found in the README.md file in the 'resources' directory link [here](https://github.com/tabburn/CO2-emissions-by-vehicle/tree/main/resources).
